Learning how to use GitHub

John here, this is a simple project to help me get familiar with using GitHub. So far things are going well. I'm trying to learn GitHub because I just learned how to code in Python a little, and I want to start working on a project to reinforce what I've learned. To do this, I thought I could kill two birds with one stone and learn how to use this popular online version control system that was built on Git.
